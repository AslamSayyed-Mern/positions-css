                <li>HTML </li>
                <p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language and is used to structure content on the web.
                    It uses tags like h1 for headings, p for paragraphs, and img for images.
                    The basic layout of an HTML page includes html, head, and body sections.
                    HTML is responsible for what content appears on a page, not how it looks.
                    To style a webpage, we use CSS, and for interactivity, we use JavaScript.
                    Every website you visit is built with HTML as its foundation.
                    It's the first step in web development and easy to start learning!
                    
                    
                </p>

                <li>CSS</li>
                <p>CSS is used to style and design web pages made with HTML.
                    It controls the layout, colors, fonts, spacing, and overall visual look of a page.
                    You can apply styles directly with inline CSS, internally within a style tag, or externally via a CSS file.
                    Common properties include color, background, margin, padding, and font-size.
                    CSS makes websites responsive and visually appealing on all devices.
                    With Flexbox and Grid, layout design becomes more flexible and powerful.
                    It's a must-have skill for every front-end developer.

                <li>Python</li>
                <p>Python is a high-level, beginner-friendly programming language known for its simplicity.
                    It uses clean and readable syntax, which makes it great for beginners and professionals alike.
                    Python is used in web development, data science, automation, machine learning, and more.
                    It supports multiple programming paradigms like procedural, object-oriented, and functional.
                    Popular frameworks include Django for web apps and Pandas for data analysis.
                    With huge community support and tons of libraries, Python is very versatile.
                    It’s one of the most in-demand languages in today’s tech world.</p>
